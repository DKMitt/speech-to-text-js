## Converting from Speech to Text with JavaScript

Purpose of this app is to experiment with the Web Speech API by using the browser interface which allows you to record human speech and convert it into text and then convert the text back into speech. 

Going to use the Web Speech API to build a voice powered note app that does 3 things:

 - Takes notes by using voice-to-text or keyboard input.
 - Save voice notes to localStorage.
 - Display all of the saved notes and give the option to either listen or delete them.
